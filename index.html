    <div class="part1">
        <h3>Population Distribution</h3>


        <div class='part1_images' id="geographic_map"></div>
        <p id="part1_text_1">Australia's east coast - New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland were the most densely 
            populated Australian States in 2019. This means a number of things:<br>
            1. You are bound to meet various different ethnicities from all over the world in these states<br>
            2. These states have many tourist attractions to go to and experience<br>
            3. It is likely these 3 states are the most expensive compared to other states<br>
            If you're a tourist, it is highly probably you are going to enjoy New South Wales and/or 
            Victoria. Whereas if you are a family looking to settle, it is likely Western Australia might be most suitbale; where prices may not be 
            the highest and at the same time you get to enjoy being around a community of both Australians and people of various other cultures.
        </p>


        <div class='part1_images' id="percentage_bar_chart"></div>
        <p id="part1_text_2">If we look further into the population split - most states' population will be 
            urban based; namely for access to essentials like healthcare and good quality food. For those who don't mind small communities, then 
            the Northern Territory or even Tasmania might be best suited for them. On the other hand, if one wants 
            the freedom to pick between urban or rural without compromising on population density, then Queensland or South 
            Australia might be more preferred options.

        <h3>Popularity and Crowdedness</h2>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <p>When observing the piecharts on the right, one can infer that tourists come and go as expected (short-term). However a notable
                    observation is that the proportion of those with long-term/permanent arrivals far exceeds those who are departing long-term.
                    This suggests that there are relatively more people who want to live in Australia (long-term stays) than those who perhaps might not have enjoyed
                    it as much (long-term departures); this could indicate Australia's openness to accomodate people of different cultures
                    and backgrounds regardless of whether they are a family, a student or just about anyone.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2" id="pie_charts">
            

            </div>

            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <p>From observing the barchart on the right, one can make two comments - Queensland is the most popular state to emigrate to for those
                    living in other states, and New South Wales is the least favourite. Using this barchart alongside the first 2 charts, an assumption can be made - people will tend to 
                    choose New South Wales as the state to live in, however may later find it very expensive or too crowded; and hence why after some time they 
                    will leave the state. On the contrary, Queensland is garnering the attention of those living in other states. Once again, based on the previous
                    charts, an assumption can be made - the state is not relatively overpopulated and therefore may not be as expensive as the other states, which could explain
                    its popularity amongst Australian residents.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2" id="diverging_bar_chart">

    </div>


    <div class="part3">
        <h3>How Family-Friendly is Australia?</h2>
        <p>When observing the left chart below, we can deduce that every decade, Australia's overall average life-expectancy at birth increases by 2 
            years. The Northern Territory and Tasmania have had the lowest life expectancy across 2 decades, this could be as a result of a potential reduction in 
            availability to high-quality foods and/or limited healthcare infrastructure. On the other hand, Western 
            Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have dominated the leaderboard in life-expectancy over the 2 past decades. With a relatively small population in both states, 
            diseases and infections do not spread easily and therefore the general health of those living in those states may be better than those in other densely populated states. This in-turn 
            could explain why both of these states have had higher life-expectancy estimates than other states.
            <br>
            <br>
            By a similar token, when observing the chart on the bottom right, the median age of mothers across all Australian states has also seen a 
            steady and somewhat linear increase over the past 4 decades; where the average age of a mother was roughly 26 in 1980 and 31 in 2020. An 
            increase in the median age of mothers could potentially be a byproduct of having increased opportunities for early-life education, such as 
            pursuing research and further study in one's field of work. With increased education opportunities, this may eventually have a positive impact on 
            families' work and financial stability. Once again, the Australian Capital Territory has had one of the highest median ages of mothers in 
            the past 4 decades, indicating that this state could be a good candidate for those looking for education or work opportunities whilst 
            also being able to raise their family.
